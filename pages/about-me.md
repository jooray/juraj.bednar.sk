My name is Juraj Bednár. I am an entrepreneur, hacker and explorer. It is difficult to write something "about me", because life is so complex and I try to do a lot of interesting stuff.

I wrote my first program when I was 6 years old. Later I have become involved with open-source, Linux (as a user, then administrator and system architect) and redundant server solutions. It all goes hand in hand with security and cryptography. I am very interested in wider implication of technologies. I studied artificial intelligence and I try to figure out what's the real difference between computer programs and people :).

I am a co-founder of [Citadelo](https://www.citadelo.com/) (with Vladislav and Tomáš Zaťko) - a team of hackers (called penetration testers or ethical hackers). Our main security service is a simulated hacker attack directed at your web or mobile application. We use and contribute to OWASP Testing Guide. We have tested several financial applications for insurance companies and banks and e-commerce solutions (credit card processor, e-shops, ...). We also serve Czech market with [Citadelo CZ](https://www.citadelo.cz/) which we co-founded with Martin Leskovjan.

I also co-created a sharing-economy service for hackers and
a bug bounty program called [Hacktrophy](https://www.hacktrophy.com/).
We are serving mainly European market - we are the first European bug
bounty program provider.

I am currently working on projects related to cryptocurrencies -
security, smart contracts, ...

I am always looking for new opportunities, friendships and ventures.

Entrepreneurship is key to creating abundance in this world. Creativity and productivity solve poverty and improve people's lives in a way that no state agency can. I am involved with Bitcoin - an alternative currency that will probably make sending and receiving money easier for entrepreneurs and people around the world, not only in the "western countries". 

Travel; that's how I learn about the world. I like hacking travel too.

I am a co-founder and active member of Bratislava's hackerspace [Progressbar](http://www.progressbar.sk/) and Prague's best venue - [Paralelní Polis](http://paralelnipolis.cz/). It hosts a hackerspace called [Institute of Cryptoanarchy](http://www.paralelnipolis.cz/cryptoanarchy-institute/) and a cafeteria with best coffee in Prague and accepting only Bitcoin.

I wrote some interesting code that can be found over at [Github](https://github.com/jooray) or our company's [open-source page](http://www.digmia.com/pages/en/products/open-source.html)
