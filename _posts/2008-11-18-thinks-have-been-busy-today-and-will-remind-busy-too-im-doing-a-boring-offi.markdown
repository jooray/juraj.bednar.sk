Thinks have been busy today and will remind busy too. I'm doing a boring office and meeting work since Vlado left. No paragliding on sunday and monday (bad weather), but I have my glider ready for whenever the weather is good.  
  
I've been thinking about creating some weather auto-notifier (like "go gliding there, there's a good wind for starts and good weather for flying in general"). It could harvest information from weather forecast sites and paragliding sites... Could be fun, given enough time...  
  
I met some friends during the weekend, went to visit my little bro and his girlfriend and so on. Tomorrow, I will be mostly offline in Hainburg.  
  
Write me :) !
