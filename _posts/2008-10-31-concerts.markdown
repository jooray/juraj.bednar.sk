Yesterday, I [ saw][1] [TV Buddhas][2], [::.:][3] + urban failure and [Beehatch][4]. I really like them all, more points for making it non-smoking concert.

Today, I've seen [Ralph Meyerz and The Jack Herren Band][5], which was also very inspiring (I was almost asleep on the concert). They looked a little bit egotripping, but indeed played some good music.

I really love going to concerts and I usually end up with an urge to create something, the best "art" ideas come out usually when I'm listening to good music or when I see good movie.
