While I mostly don't like this article, it shows one thing security analyst love to repeat all and all again: that airport security is more "security theatre" than security. I completely agree with the last part:  
  
_Many thoughtful travelers know that the rigamarole we go through on the way to our airline gates is a show to comfort the ignorant, to keep them buying airline tickets. Tell the truth, save our time, save our money. Let us resume our old carefree stroll to the gate. Spend some of the $3 billion on real police work to catch the bad guys. That would make us safer._
