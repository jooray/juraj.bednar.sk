After JavaDay (liked presentations about Oracle Coherence, NetBeans and OpenESB / SOA).  
  
Installed NetBeans 6.5, played with JavaFx.  
  
Learned a lot about enterprise clustering using Glassfish. Still don't understand Terracota.  
  
Found about [Devoxx][1] conference, it's sold out, but watched some videos from 2007 and looking forward to see videos from this year's edition, there are some interesting talks.  
  
I think I have a coding phase and would like to do a lot of coding.
