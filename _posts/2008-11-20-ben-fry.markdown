is an author of [Processing][1] -- a very simple environment for digital art. It allows you to create music, video, images and interactive projects, publish them on a web site like Java applet. It is not a difficult programming environment, it works as Sketches, you just open, sketch a code and run it. Has several sister projects like [Arduino][2], [Wiring][3] and [Processing Mobile][4].  
  
Ben has written two books on visualizing data.  
  
His site has lots of visualizations and my latest fetish -- [genetic data][5] and their visualizations.
