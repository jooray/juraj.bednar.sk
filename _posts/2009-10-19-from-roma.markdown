In short: Great food, great concerts (although sound during the first day was awful). i hate how everything is open or closed according to phase of the moon, christian holidays, weather or other weird stuff. You can't get pizza during lunch, they are for dinner only. Afternoon sabat? Only sandwitches and sweets. Sunday? Most stuff closed. I may be lazy city bastard living next to non-stop Tesco. But I don't understand how this country could work. I understand bankrupcy of Alitalia. Rome is (for several other reasons) no longer a place to go, if there's no other good reason to be here. Dirty, unfriendly, crowded. Looking forward home.
