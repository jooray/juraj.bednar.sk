Most of you probably know Bugmenot.com. If not, here's the deal: You come to read an article on a site or a forum post and it says: "okay, it's free, but you need to register first". The site is bugging you and you don't want that, so you go to bugmenot.com and get some registration someone else has created before. If there's none, you can use disposable e-mail address (so you don't need to create new free e-mail account or gets tons of spam), receive site's confirmation code, create an account and submit it back.  
  
RetailMeNot is a similiar approach to coupon codes. During the payment process many online stores will have a field to enter a coupon or promotion code. Entering a special code will give you a discounted rate or free extras.  
  
If you are lazy like me, you can use the firefox extension. Don't worry, it downloads the database, it does not notify retailmenot about every site you visit. But suppose you visit a book store or a tea store and a notification pops up: there are coupon codes available.   
  
I got quite a few discounts this way, so I thought I'll share again.   
  
If you are not using Firefox, there's a bookmarklet.  
  
And if you want to buy some Darjeeling tea on my favourite store: Thunderbolttea.com and you want it now (which I don't recommend -- wait for fabulous first flush 2009 teas), use the code I just submitted there.
