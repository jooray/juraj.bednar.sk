Most libertarians will go through several phases. Seeing the inefficiency or injustice of the state is one of them. I want to suggest that there is another phase: Taking your liberty into your own hands. Hate taxes? Go to tax haven! Don't like public schools? Unschool your kids. Do you want banking privacy? Cryptos! Don't like traditional models of relationships? Invent and build your own.

This is a talk from HCPP 2017 about how to get your freedom - here and
now.
