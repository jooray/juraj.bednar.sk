### I have thoughts about genetics with a new book about it on my table, thinking about Sun on Oracle conference (they are very happy of the aquisition, I am happy, that there is a new version of both MySQL and MySQL cluster). Had wine from Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and my favourite from Napa, California. Last one before going to the room was Canadian one. Heard stories from the great travellers and explorers. Dreamy.
