People are telling me, that comparative advertisement is allowed in Slovakia for a few years now. I have never seen that actually work, maybe it's just the advertising culture not being adapted to that kind of advertising. But I remember one mobile operator having had a big problem when doing that in the past... Breakfast here is one dining room, where people sit around one table and eat anything they want from quite a full kitchen. My first Darjeeling (Goomtee FF 2008) here in NY and quite a nice conversation with people sitting around that table. No one flew with Alitalia...
