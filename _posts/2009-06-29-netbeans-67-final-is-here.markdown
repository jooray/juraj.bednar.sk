NetBeans 6.7 is now available for [download][1]. The site includes their usual [screencasts][2] (see specially the [Overview][3]) and [Tutorials][4].

The new features I find most interesting are the [Connected Developer][5] and the [Build Tool][6] support (including Hudson and Maven). Other features include support for more [Dynamic Languages][7], [Java Desktop/Swing][8] and [Web and Java EE][9]; bundled JavaEE 6 and JavaFX 1.2 will be in later releases.
