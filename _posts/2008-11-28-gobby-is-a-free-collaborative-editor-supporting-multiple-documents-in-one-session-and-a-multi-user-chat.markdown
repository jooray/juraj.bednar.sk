Gobby is a free collaborative editor supporting multiple documents in one session and a multi-user chat.  
  
It simply allows multiple users to edit the same document at one time -- together, over network. I kind of like it, it has quite a bad Mac port. But anyways, it's quite good for collaboration, especially because of their Avahi support, which means, you can start the session just by connecting to the same local network and using autodiscovery.
