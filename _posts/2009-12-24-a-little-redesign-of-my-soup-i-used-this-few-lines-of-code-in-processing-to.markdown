A little [redesign of my soup][2], I used this few lines of code in [Processing][3] to create background image (and then resized it in [Gimp][4], which produced the resulting background noise, matching the black sun background noise).  
  
Anyway, this post is here to show, that:   
  
a.) Processing is really easy to use  
  
and  
  
b.) I like grey minimal :).  
  
Enjoy.
