A [possible solution to the mystery of the Voynich Manuscript.][1] _"The [Voynich Manuscript][2] has confounded attempts to decode it for nearly 100 years. A person named Edith Sherwood, who has previously suggested a [possible link to DaVinci][3], has a new idea: perhaps the text is simply anagrams of Italian words. There are three pages of examples from the herb section of the book, showing the original text, the plaintext Italian words, and the English equivalents. Has someone cracked the code?"_
