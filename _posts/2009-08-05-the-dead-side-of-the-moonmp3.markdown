Artist: Steven Stapleton and David Tibet Album: Octopus Track: The Dead Side of the Moon Category: Romance in the Other World Steven Stapleton (of Nurse With Wound) and David Tibet (of Current 93) made this remarkable track, which I first saw live at Nurse with Wound concert at Donau Festival last year. First caution: if you don't like noise music, this is the longest version available, you should skip to the main part, which starts at 07:00. I like the noise beginning and also the ending (which seamlessly continues to The Bubblehead) on Octopus EP. This takes me to the other world, to a dreamland of moon with water reflections. This is a black and white world, very alternative, this is not for everyone, but for me, this is one of the best songs ever.
