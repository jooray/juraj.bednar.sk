[2 Earth-sized bodies with oxygen rich atmospheres found- but they’re stars not planets][2]  
  
_"Astrophysicists at the University of Warwick and Kiel University have discovered [two bodies the size of earth with oxygen-rich atmospheres][3] — however, there is a disappointing snag for anyone looking for a potential home for alien life, or even a future home for ourselves. These are not planets, but are actually two unusual white dwarf stars."_
