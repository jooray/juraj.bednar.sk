I was wondering, how difficult is it to send money anonymously. I've been envisioning things like E-gold payments, going through different accounts and then getting the money out with credit card, or something like that.  
  
Or anonymous wire transfer via a third party.  
  
Western union done by some homeless guy.  
  
But then I found out, that the easiest thing is purely non-technological and simple. Put the money in the envelope and send it as a letter. 1 EUR first class.  
  
(Someone wanted anonymous domain registration, so I wanted to find out how to do it).
