It seems, that they did a lot of improvement to the standard library, which was one of my main concerns when writing Python.  
  
Of course they had to break backwards compatibility, but I would not see this as such a bad thing. Anyways, porting is almost always required for programs going from 2.x to 3.0 Python, especially because print is now a function, not a statement.
