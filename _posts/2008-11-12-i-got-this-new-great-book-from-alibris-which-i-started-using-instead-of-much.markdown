I got this new great book from [Alibris][2] (which I started using instead of much more expensive Amazon and not-having-everything-I-want eBay for books).   
  
I was introduced to this book by Katka &amp; Hugo in Seoul, I read it for a while in subway and I really loved it. It's brilliant and funny.   
  
I found out, that it's based on [this site][3] (or the site is based on book?)  
  
So if you want to read it online, do it. I prefer reading it somewhere not behind a computer, so I like the paper book. And I can borrow it to people.   
  
It's funny and brilliant.
