_After 2 years of waiting, _[Project Crossbow][1]_ has arrived! It integrated into Nevada Build 105 on Dec 4th, and BFU's became available around the middle of the month._

Crossbow is both Network Virtualization (we looked at that above) and Network Resource Control. With Crossbow we have a real network resource control capability that is free from the terror that is IPQoS.

I really recommend reading this article, if you are interested in Solaris.
