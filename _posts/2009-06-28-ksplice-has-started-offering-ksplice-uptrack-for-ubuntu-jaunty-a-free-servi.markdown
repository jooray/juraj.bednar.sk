"_"[Ksplice][1] has started offering [Ksplice Uptrack][2] for Ubuntu Jaunty, a free service that delivers rebootless versions of all the latest Ubuntu kernel security updates. It's currently available for both the 32 and 64-bit generic kernel, and they plan to add support for the virtual and server kernels by the end of the month, [according to their FAQ][3]. This makes Ubuntu the first OS that doesn't need to be rebooted for security updates. (We [covered Ksplice's underlying technology][4] when it was first announced a year ago.)"_"
