_Time loop logic_, coined by the roboticist and futurist [Hans Moravec][1],[[11]][2] is the name of a hypothetical system of computation that exploits the Novikov self-consistency principle to compute answers much faster than possible with the standard model of [computational complexity][3] using [Turing machines][4]. In this system, a computer sends a result of a computation [backwards through time][5] and relies upon the self-consistency principle to force the sent result to be correct.

A program exploiting time loop logic can be quite simple in outline. For example, to compute one [prime factor][6] of the [natural number][7] _N_ in polynomial time (no polynomial time factorization algorithm is known in traditional complexity theory; see _[integer factorization][8]_):
