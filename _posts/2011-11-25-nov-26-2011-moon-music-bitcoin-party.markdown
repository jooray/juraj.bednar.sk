20:00 @ Brmlab, Bubenska 1, Prague

Playing: Visuals and Moon music by Monroe Noir More moon music by evad After short afternoon delight, we will fly to the moon and back. No pop until late hours, so you are safe. This world is dark, as we need to employ cryptoanarchy. Spies are everywhere. People are listening. Visit our party and dream in a black and white world of moon music. Talk to us about Bitcoin and/or your dreams in the fantastic Prague hackerspace Brmlab. Entry free, everyone is invited.
