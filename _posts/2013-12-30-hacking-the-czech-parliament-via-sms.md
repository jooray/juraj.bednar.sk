Hacking the Czech Parliament via SMS
A parliamentary drama of 223 actors

The Czech art collective Ztohoven' project "Moral Reform" was
accomplished in collaboration with web security experts. Together they
created the unique art concept of a mobile phone mass-hack.

"Am I the only one who sees all the bad things we do? It's impossible to
govern in a decent way anymore. Let's finish it once for all. I am ready
to overtake the responsibility. I am ready to reveal the full truth."

Messages like these were received by Ministers from their government
fellows.
