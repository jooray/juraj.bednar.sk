Everyone looks funny when they sleep   
Their dreams telling stories  
Snoring  
Funny when they sleep  
  
Their inmost wish vaporizes in the air   
Telling   
Wishing   
The story is:  
Everyone looks funny when they sleep   
  
Naked   
Not their body, their mind naked   
  
Pure child  
  
Asleep
