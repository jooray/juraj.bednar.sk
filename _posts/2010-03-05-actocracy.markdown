[Reposted from [kyrah][1]]

I actually started using Actocracy in our [Society for Open Information Technologies][2] (there was an everlasting flamewar about which CMS to use for web, so we decided to ask those who would be doing it).   
Anyway, I wanted to say, that I don't like the greek word, actocracy is kind-of self explanatory for those, that don't speak greek (it has nothing to do about the fact, that I'm mad at greeks for devalving my currency and making my trip to Asia being more expensive!).  
Anyway, +1 for actocracy, -1 for poietocracy from my side...  
How does actocracy apply for this kind of discussion? :)
