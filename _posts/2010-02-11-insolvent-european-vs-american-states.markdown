While all the investing world seems to be utterly fixated on the outcome of _Greece’s solvency_ woes, perhaps we need to step back and put this into perspective.

Portugal, Ireland, Italy Greece and Spain are in varied degrees of difficulty; but how significant are the PIIGS’ debts to the world’s economy? (If they require a workout, perhaps they can what we do. Give them lower rates and an extended term and/or a _cramdown_ to their lenders).

In contrast, consider the distressed United States: How do our own economic “pigs” measure up? In terms of economic importance relative to the world, aren’t the bigger US States that are in deep distress more important (GDP sizewise)?

Consider the size of the budget issues and debt load in dollar and percentage terms for just these six states relative to their European cousins
