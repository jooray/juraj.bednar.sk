[Battlefield: Canvas][2]  
  
There are some new people not from Slovakia reading my blog, so I wanted to show you one interesting competition, it's called [Battlefield: Canvas][3] and it's a drawing competition. Everyone has six hours and can post their paintings on a given theme. This time it was "A long forgotten hotel in a valley of rocky mushrooms" (yes, the translation is correct).  
  
This picture is the one I like most, but see [others here][4] (you don't need Kyberia login to see this).
