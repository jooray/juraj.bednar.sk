The eye of our Big brother is spying on us all. Edward Snowden
revelations have taught us that there is no place to hide. However, we
can protect our communication by using a bunch of tools and apps. Come
and start using them right away!

This was a little bit of "improv" part of LibertyCon Prague 2017, where
Institute of Cryptoanarchy in Paralelni Polis organized a half-secret
(meaning some were not part of the official program) track of talks :).

The co-author of the slides and talk is Pavol Luptak.
