A detailed simulation of a small region of a brain built molecule by molecule has been constructed and has [recreated experimental results from real brains][1]. The "Blue Brain" has been put in a virtual body, and observing it gives the first indications of the molecular and neural basis of thought and memory. Scaling the simulation to the human brain is only a matter of money, says the project's head. The work was presented at the European Future Technologies meeting in Prague.
