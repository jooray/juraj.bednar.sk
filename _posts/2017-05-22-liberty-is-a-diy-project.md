A recording from my HCPP 2016 talk. In previous years I had a talk
about why I think Liberty is a DIY project - that it's a personal
responsibility of each and every one of us. Then I had two presentations
about hacking the biology of our bodies and brain. This talk is
continuation of all this work - how does liberty tie to our health,
mental and physical performance? What are some of the best hacks
to be more free, improve your brain and bodily function?

Make sure to come to [Liberate! - Hackers Congress Paraleln√≠
Polis](https://liberate.hcpp.cz) in Prague, I have something even more
epic and you wouldn't believe what kind of speakers will be there. This
is for me the best conference there is with no close second.
