I just came back from a friendly lunch with Oracle Euro Conversion Squad from Bangalore, India (and my mum).  
  
We were talking a lot about travelling and here are some pictures from Angkor-wat area (in Cambodia). There are many really nice shots of this magical place, I don't have so many good photos right now, so I recommend seeing these...
