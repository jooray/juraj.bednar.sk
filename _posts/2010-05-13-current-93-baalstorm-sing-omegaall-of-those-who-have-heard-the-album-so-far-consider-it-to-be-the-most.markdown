Current 93 - _Baalstorm, Sing Omega_

All of those who have heard the album so far consider it to be the most emotionally powerful and raw release yet by C93. The lineup of the group is: Eliot Bates, James Blackshaw, John Contreras, Baby Dee, Andrew Liles, Melon Liles, Alex Neilson, Bea Taylor, Isabel Taylor and David Tibet.  
  
 The album will be available as both as a CD digipak and 12" single LP in a single sleeve with elaborate artwork by David.
