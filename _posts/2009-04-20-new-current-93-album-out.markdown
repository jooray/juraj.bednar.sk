![][1]Aleph At Hallucinatory Mountain is the long-awaited new album  
 from Current 93 and their first album in three years,  
 following on from their double-platinum-selling album Black  
 Ships Ate The Sky, and is released on David Tibet's new label  
 Coptic Cat.  
  
 Aleph At Hallucinatory Mountain is the most unique, most  
 unpredictable and most powerful album yet from Current 93.  
 David has brought together an amazing and bizarre array of  
 talents from artists as varied as Nurse With Wound's Stapleton  
 and Liles, rock god phenomenon Andrew W.K., haunting chanteuse  
 and composer Baby Dee, Grammy award-winning genius Rickie Lee  
 Jones, the beautiful Hush Arbor's Keith Wood, world famous  
 porn-star (and winner of the Best Three Way Sex Scene and Best  
 Group Scene at the Adult Video Network awards) Sasha Grey,  
 Pantaleimon's enchanted Andria Degens, guitar-hero James  
 Blackshaw, Cyclobe and Coil's Ossian Brown, NYC legend Matt  
 Sweeney (ZWAN, Neil Diamond, Superwolf), extraordinary  
 percussionist supreme Alex Neilson (Red Krayola, Trembling  
 Bells, Bonnie 'Prince' Billy), counter-culture guru William  
 Breeze and heavenly cellist John Contreras (Marc Almond, Baby  
 Dee) and created an album unlike any other ever. Ever!
