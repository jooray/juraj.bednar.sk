This. Was. Awesome. My [favorite place in the world][1] was full of current, hardly-ever-anymore and not-yet acquaintances. There was food for thought and for the stomach, sad music and happy music, intellectually and emotionally stimulating moments, and importantly also _fuck-it-let's-dance_ — at least all that was the intention I hope came across.  
Some dear friends performed: When we weren't fighting with Skype, [Alex][2] encouraged us to aim for the human singularity (using all human brains to their full potential) before we reach the technological one. @[kyrah][3] got us up to speed on what might turn out to be one of the most significant political events of our lifetimes. @[boysoprano][4] stood on stage for the first time in his life, and who knew his voice is that good? :). @[moep][5] spontaneously decided to show off his new-found Gameboy music skills. @[jooray][6] livehacked great audiovisuals. Ben and his friend Christian made lovely cupcakes. @[nex][7] did something or other with DDR in the lounge… sorry, didn't catch it myself so I don't know how much of the initial plan was realized ;)  
All contributors I didn't yet know – @[claus][8], Sebastian, Ana, Tomas and Ulrika, all of whom I just randomly emailed (or was introduced to) a few weeks ago – turned out to be most wonderful people.  
Late at night, a whole new group arrived from who knows where, started using blue tape like war paint and sang along to the DJ. And even the police came by to party in their own special way ♥  
There were some unfortunate tech fuckups and delays, and my shipment of zines didn't arrive in time – oh well.I'm sure not everyone enjoyed everything on stage as much as I did – I was actually really positively surprised by the interest shown. So many people I only vaguely know listening intently to transhumanist and political talks at what was advertised as a party for lack of a better word? So many people who had never heard her music (beyond a short sample at best) dancing along to Compute? Either of those is unusual, but both with the same crowd?!  
It was a "party" designed to also appeal to people who don't usually party all that much, and I think that worked well.The people I care about seemed to enjoy the night, and that made it so worth the effort!  
I couldn't have done it without @[oib][9], @[meta][10], @[fin][11], @[kay][12], @[jain7th][13], @[stereotype][14], Lukas... the folks at [Lomo][15], all the barkeepers including @[tomk32][16], @[wizard23][17], @[nickless][18], @[durchzug][19], @[kallaballa][20] and the cleanup team the next day. Sorry for not showing up before Monday morning: I was completely out of order, exhausted like I've hardly ever been after barely three hours of sleep the night before and all the preparations and last-minute things. Next time I'll budget professional cleaning.  
_"Standing on stage and being able to look at a crowd of people and say 'hey, I by all rights shouldn't be here, but as the result of accepting an opportunity here I am…', I think that's a huge life changer for me."_ said [Dallas][21] in the intro video, and that's how I felt as well. A few years ago I would never ever have imagined I'd be organizing something like this, and that so many great people would show up and enjoy it.[Thank you][22] :)
