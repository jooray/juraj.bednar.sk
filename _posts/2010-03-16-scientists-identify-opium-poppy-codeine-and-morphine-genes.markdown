This means, you could theoretically implant this gene to potatoes. It will be very difficult time for drug law enforcement.   
  
I've been saying the same about THC yesterday -- what if someone took a gene and implanted it to mint? How do you tell if you have illegal version of mint? If you make tea, it's just that -- mint. If you smoke it, you get high. But how can you be responsible for knowing THC content of mint you just bought in Vietnamese flea-market?  
  
Time for paradigm shift in this area is coming.
