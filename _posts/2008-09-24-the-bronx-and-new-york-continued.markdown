Yesterday was a good weather for visiting the Liberty and Elis islands.  
Elis island was really interesting for me, it was an entry place for  
immigrants before allowing to enter New York harbour.   
  
I was very tired of walking. We had a food in Thai restaurant. The best  
Thai food, even better than anything I ate in Thailand itself (but it  
had lots of common with traditional Thai food). It was a red snapper with  
mushroom sauce and two 22oz strong (5% alcohol) thai beers. I was  
pretty tired, so the Low concert was mainly a stand-by sleeping excercise,  
but I loved a few tracks. Definitely much better than the Stars concert.  
  
Today, we went to see The Bronx. It is really a nice place (no problems  
like in american films, everyone riding their huge SUVs there, no white  
day street violence or such stuff). But it is much cheaper, restaurants  
and shopping. Met some slovaks in Bronx Zoo, they said, that they were  
on a cruise from Miami through Carribean (Jamaica, Caiman islands, Dominican  
Republic). It was a week cruise, all food in price (only alcohol excluded)  
and they saw bunch of stuff. But anyway, the price for all of this was  
$500. I would definitely love to do that, if I find a ticket to Miami  
from Europe. The cruise company is called Carnival.  
  
However, the very best part of all of this is having an Anxi Oolong tea  
in a place called Teaspot (they have tea and wifi hotspot here). Nothing  
better for me. I can sit, read my e-mail, post this blog and drink a  
really good tea. Feels almost like home. Also chatting with tea-people  
working here...  
  
I love New York, it is really a best city I ever visited and if I wanted  
to move far away, I would probably consider this place among first ones...
