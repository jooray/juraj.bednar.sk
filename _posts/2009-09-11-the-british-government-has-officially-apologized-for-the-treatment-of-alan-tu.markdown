"The British government has officially apologized for the treatment of Alan Turing in the post war era. An [online petition][1] got more than enough signatures to force an official statement and Prime Minister Gordon Brown has issued a [lengthy apology][2]. 'Thousands of people have come together to demand justice for Alan Turing and recognition of the appalling way he was treated. While Turing was dealt with under the law of the time and we can't put the clock back, his treatment was of course utterly unfair and I am pleased to have the chance to say how deeply sorry I and we all are for what happened to him. So on behalf of the British government, and all those who live freely thanks to Alan's work I am very proud to say: we're sorry, you deserved so much better.'"
