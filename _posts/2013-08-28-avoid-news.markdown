If you have an intellectual minute, read [Avoid news by Rolf Dobelli](http://dobelli.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/Avoid_News_Part1_TEXT.pdf)

I highly agree. I have not watched TV for years now (we don't have
a subscription and I did not bother installing an antenna) and I've
been practicing a healthy news diet for
more than a year now. It really helps, especially with focus. The
justifications in the article are sound, and I highly agree with this article. Nothing
important passed my attention - someone always tells me. I am sometimes in
an awkward situation when I don't know that our country's president
said something stupid again, but I am actually proud of it.

I try to learn more about internal structures of the world by reading books. I
add to the suggested diet by reading books which I know I won't
agree with to challenge what I believe. I also try to talk to people with
opinions highly different than mine.

Also read [this article by N. N. Taleb](http://ow.ly/og9KM) which explains
why noise explodes faster than data (and thus why you should read less news,
not more). Warning: equations ahead! :)

If you are trying to replace news with some really interesting reading,
I highly suggest [Taleb's Antifragile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile:_Things_That_Gain_from_Disorder)
and Dobelli's [The Art of Thinking Clearly](http://www.dobelli.com/). Both
are both interesting and very valuable. They will both also improve your
life, not only stimulate your intellect.

What do you think?
