"The suit claims that [AT&amp;T should turn over unused balances on the calling cards][1] of consumers whose last known address was in Washington, D.C. and have not used the calling card for three years. 'AT&amp;T's prepaid calling cards must be treated as unclaimed property under district law,' the attorney general's office said in a statement. ... [That sum] represents some 5 to 20 percent of the total balances purchased by consumers who use the calling cards. States and municipalities have often similarly used unclaimed property laws, known as escheat laws, to claim ownership of unused retail gift card balances."
