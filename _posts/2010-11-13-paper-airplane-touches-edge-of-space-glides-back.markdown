"Brits Steve Daniels, John Oates and Lester Haines just became the envy of geeks the world over. The trio 'built a one-wing glider from paper, [lofted it to the edge of space][1] at 90,000 feet with a helium balloon, and [posted sound and video recordings][2] from the plane as it glided safely back to the ground,' writes blogger Kevin Fogarty. The Register newspaper sponsored the stunt and [reported each step of the process][3]. And British defense-contractor Qinetiq supplied the cameras and testing chambers, says Fogarty."  
  
I always wanted to do this.
