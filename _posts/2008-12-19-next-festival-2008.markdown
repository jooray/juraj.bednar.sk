Angel was quite minimal, it is a really good music before sleeping, but otherwise not that interesting.  
[  
Xavier van Wersch][1] was more fun, he was playing on measuring cup with absinthe and spoon, touching resistors on old radio, bubbles in absinthe or some weird analogue synth attached to gas mask.  
  
I had a good time. Next is not that much for listening, but really a new experience.  
  
Met Wilder, Komik, Crankyjack, Gali (and of course Slash). It was fun.  
  
Hope to see more people tomorrow.
