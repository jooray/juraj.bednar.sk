Flying in a light milky clouds, in an airplane creating light Brian Eno sounds, turbulences adding rhythm. Just remembered Neal Gaiman, how he writes blogs in the plane all the time. I wrote two short articles. Apocalypse by Current 93 in my ears. "Surely, we are living in a dream" says David.

Landed. Let's drive.
