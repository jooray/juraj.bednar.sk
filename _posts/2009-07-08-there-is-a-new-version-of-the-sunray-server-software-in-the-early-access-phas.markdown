"There is a new version of the SunRay Server Software in the early access phase: [Sun Ray Software 5 and Sun Ray Soft Client 1.0 Early Access 1 (EA1)][1]. There is especially one interesting new feature: A Sun Ray Soft Client for Windows, thus you can use a desktop as a Sun Ray for the time of the migration towards a pure Sun Ray solution."
