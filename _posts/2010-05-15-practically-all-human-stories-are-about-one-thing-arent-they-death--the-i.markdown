"Practically all human stories are about one thing, aren't they: death. The inevitability of death. All men must die, but for every man his death is an accident and, even if he knows it and consents to it, an unjustifiable violation. And whether you agree with those words or not, they are key to the Lord of the Rings."

â€“J. R. R. Tolkien in an audio interview
