**Black Sun Eclipse**  
  
In my dream I saw the black sun rise  
heard beats of my heart  
the eclipse came  
and I was lost behind event horizon  
is there always waking up?  
  
When I was younger,  
I thought about black sun rise  
I saw small black stars  
In young children's eyes  
Nicer than any thought  
Purer than any dream  
  
Who needs black suns?  
Their time has gone  
We only remember  
and sometimes dream  
of long gone suns  
vanished in eclipse  
  
But then -- who needs black suns these times?  
Wasn't the eclipse the nicest thing?  
Who needs eternity?  
Who needs?  
Who?
