This is (for now) my new wallpaper (I'm talking about primary monitor, secondary monitor has always different wallpaper, at home or at work).  
  
I've been a fan of Ryan Bliss's work for quite a long time, being a subscriber to his site Digital Blasphemy (this image is for members, that's the reason it's in so low resolution here).  
  
He has been creating these different worlds and places digitally for quite a time now, his most known work is probably [Fluorescence][2], which I like very much...  
  
Go people, create art!
