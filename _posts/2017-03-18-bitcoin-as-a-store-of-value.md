A little bit more "technical" talk about using Bitcoin as a store of
value, not as a transactional system. Does the value of Bitcoin in terms
of state currencies actually have to be stable and/or not volatile?

Is there a market in storing wealth in cryptocurrencies? Should all
people save in one currency?

This was a little bit of "improv" part of LibertyCon Prague 2017, where
Institute of Cryptoanarchy in Paralelni Polis organized a half-secret
(meaning some were not part of the official program) track of talks :).
