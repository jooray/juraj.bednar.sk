As I think of it, I think [Eclipse can do that][2] as well, they have editing of sourcecode through Jabber and [Netbeans has similiar support][3].  
  
If you want to edit documents, I've read that [Abiword][4] also has Collab plugin, though I never tried it.  
  
What I liked of Gobby is, that it is multiplatform, I don't like being tied to mac platform, although I use it. Collaboration especially should not force all users to use the same platform. Anyways, as I think of it, there are probably better solutions based on whether you want to edit source code or documents.
