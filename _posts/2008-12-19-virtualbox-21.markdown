I (internally in our company) complained about Sun releasing things such as their [StorageTek 7000 demo][1] for VMWare, while they have their own virtualization technology. The page still mentions only VMWare, but VirtualBox 2.1 can read and use VMWare VMDK images.  
  
Among other things is hardware virtualization support on Mac OS X, new networking, etc.  
  
I kind of like virtualbox, because it is open.
