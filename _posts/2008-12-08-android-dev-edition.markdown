The handset, which Google terms the Android Dev Phone 1, comes completely unlocked - able to use any GSM SIM and run unsigned applications. It's aimed at developers living beyond the reach of T-Mobile, the only network subsidising the handset, though it may appeal to anyone who doesn't want to be beholden to a network operator.
