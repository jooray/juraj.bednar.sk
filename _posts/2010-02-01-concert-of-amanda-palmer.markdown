Great. Amazing. And fun. Sang Radiohead's Creep second day in a row, this time with a crowd and Amanda's ukulele. (yesterday I had a karaoke battle with my little bro that is sadly documented and published in the cloudy net)  
  
Anyway.  
  
I somehow enjoy performers, who get drunk on the stage.  
  
But I'm a creeeeeeeeeeeeeep, I'm a weiiiiirdoooooo
