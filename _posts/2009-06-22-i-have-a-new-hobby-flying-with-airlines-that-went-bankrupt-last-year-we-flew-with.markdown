I have a new hobby: flying with airlines that went bankrupt. Last year, we flew with Alitalia to New York, they entered Chapter 11 while we were there. This august, we are flying with Sky Europe to Amsterdam. With the same people: Woody and Wilder. (In case you wonder: I'll be using Airberlin next, so sell your Airberlin stock NOW).
