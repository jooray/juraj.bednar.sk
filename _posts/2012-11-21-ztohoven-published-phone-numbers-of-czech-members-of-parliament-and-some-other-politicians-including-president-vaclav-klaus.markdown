Ztohoven published phone numbers of Czech members of parliament and some other politicians including president Vaclav Klaus.  
The project is part of their artwork called "Moral reform". At the exhibition, there is an anonymous phone that can be used to text any politician. The project started when the group sent fake texts among politicians, making it appear that there is a Moral reform coming from inside of parliament.   
I wish that the Moral reform was true, coming from the politicians. More about the project on the [web of Ztohoven][2].   
Brave and intelligent as always, thanks Ztohoven! I wish we had them here in Slovakia too (Slovak media mostly ignored both parts of Moral reform, so usual:).
