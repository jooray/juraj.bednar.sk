But today just started, right? By the way by this post is being written now, for you back in time, in Prague. (it will be posted by my mail client when I land and get out of roaming with my phone). And I smell of some Kenzo perfume I had to try because I can't find my favourite one (from Mexx). Did not like it. If you think I am weirder than usual--good point. I am. This kind of travel makes me no good. Listening to Little Boots' Hands album. Skip button used widely, but some tracks match my mood (consumer luxury style). Scotch&amp;cocaine nature. But not near any of these substances thankfully. The bus started to move towards the plane, which is good news for poor you who did not stop reading a while ago. Nice evening.
