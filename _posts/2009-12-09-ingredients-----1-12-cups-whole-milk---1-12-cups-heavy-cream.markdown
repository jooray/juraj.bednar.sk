### Ingredients

* 1 1/2 cups whole milk
* 1 1/2 cups [heavy cream][1]
* 5 large egg yolks
* 1/2 cup [sugar][2]
* 1/8 teaspoon [salt][3] (salt will give your ice cream a glossy appearance, and help to make it a little firmer)
* 1 tablespoon matcha green tea powder (do not use ordinary green tea)
* 1/4 cup [hot water][4]

### Directions

1. ##### In a medium saucepan, heat the milk and heavy cream over medium heat until small bubbles appear. Immediately remove from heat and set aside. Do not allow to boil.
2. ##### In a medium bowl, beat the egg yolks and gradually whisk in the sugar and salt. Continue whisking for 3 minutes.
3. ##### Temper the eggs by slowly whisking in a few tablespoons of the warm milk mixture. Continue to pour in the remaining milk mixture while continuously whisking, making sure no lumps form.
4. ##### Return the mixture to the saucepan and cook over low heat, stirring frequently. As soon as the mixture thickens, (about 10 minutes, it will coat the back of a spoon) remove from heat and set aside.
5. ##### In a small bowl, whisk the matcha with 1/4 cup hot water until dissolved, and pour it into the custard, whisking to combine.
6. ##### Pour the mixture through a sieve into a large bowl. Cover with a clean kitchen towel, and allow to cool to room temperature.
7. ##### Pour the custard mixture into an ice cream maker, and freeze according to manufacturer's instructions.
8. ##### Instructions if not using an ice cream maker:.
9. ##### Pour the mixture into an air tight container and freeze until set, about 3 hours.
10. ##### Remove from the container and cut into 3 inch pieces. Place in a food processor and process until smooth.
11. ##### Return to the air tight container and freeze again.
12. ##### Repeat the freezing and chopping process until a smooth consistency is reached.
