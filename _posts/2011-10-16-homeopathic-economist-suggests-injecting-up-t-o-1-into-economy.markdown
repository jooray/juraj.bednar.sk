Homeopathic economist suggests injecting ‘up to £1’ into economy Homeopathic economist suggests injecting ‘up to £1’ into economy Renowned homeopathic economist Doctor Stephen Harliton has criticised recent attempts to solve the international financial crisis. “Conventional treatments don’t work, asking people to spend less is too rational.” Harliton has calculated that £1 invested properly will completely cure the world economy. “The key is to find the correct dilution.”, explained Harliton, “I know £1 sounds a lot but if it’s introduced in 10p doses throughout the year, the economy will soon return to a balanced state. I’ve already written a series of post-dated prescriptions from my chakra book.” Doctor Harliton denied that his treatment was a licence to print money. apepper
