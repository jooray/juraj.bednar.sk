__Researchers have discovered that DNA damage decreases a cell's ability to regulate which genes are turned on and off in particular settings. This mechanism, which applies both to fungus and to us, might represent a universal culprit for aging.

"This is the first potentially fundamental, root cause of aging that we've found," says Harvard Medical School professor of pathology David Sinclair. "There may very well be others, but our finding that aging in a simple yeast cell is directly relevant to aging in mammals comes as a surprise."

I am sceptical, but it indeed is interesting. Anyways, there are other relevant genetic based research articles on aging and they seem to be quite universal too. There is (at least) one research going on about aging and Adenosine triphosphate (_...a multifunctional _[nucleotide][1]_, the most significant function of which in _[cell biology][2]_ is as a "_[molecular][3]_ currency" of intracellular _[energy][4] transfer (from Wikipedia)) and it's relation to aging and degeneration, also controlled genetically.

Either way, living long is not the main purpose of the genes, genetic evolution favors people, who live long enough to reproduce (to the extent, that the offspring will live long enough to be able to live and reproduce on their own).

Genes "want" (in the sense, that those who do it like this are numerous in population) to reproduce, not to live.

We people want to live. So I hope this research will go on and we will be able to even longer (starvation on the horizon, we're getting older and more numerous on this small planet...).
