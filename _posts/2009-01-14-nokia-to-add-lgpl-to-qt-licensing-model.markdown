After Nokia purchsed Trolltech last year, doubts arose about how Nokia would handle the dual licensing model of Qt, the advanced cross-platform toolkit which lies at the base of the KDE Free software desktop. As it turns out, these doubts were unfounded, as Nokia today [announced][1] it's going to [add the LGPL to Qt's licensing model][2], starting with Qt 4.5.
