I already mentioned [Quercus][1], a 100% Java implementation of PHP. Now I found [a nice howto][2] of how to make this work in [Glassfish][3]. There is also [PHP/java bridge][4], which allows you to bridge native PHP with Java (interacting with Java objects on the fly). It's also possible to install it into Glassfish.
