The attacks on crypto by banks and states have begun - and they might
not even be aware of it. It's emergent behavior. Let's see what
happened.

<!--more-->

First some background. The [European Union's proposed 5th Anti Money
Laundering
Directive](https://ec.europa.eu/home-affairs/sites/homeaffairs/files/what-we-do/policies/european-agenda-security/20180417_directive-proposal-facilitating-use-information-prevention-detection-investigation-prosecution-criminal-offences_en.pdf) concerns virtual currencies and anonymity directly.
Here is a helpful
[factsheet](http://ec.europa.eu/newsroom/just/document.cfm?action=display&doc_id=48935)
showing the main changes.

This is going to be implemented in the legislation of EU member
countries within 18 months of passing the directive through European
Parliament.

In Czech and Slovak republic (both members of EU), the banks have
started closing bank accounts of crypto companies - all within the same
timeframe. It is a "business decision of the bank", they never mention
any particular issue with cryptocurrencies, the bank just decided to
close the bank account.

Who are these companies? Operators of Bitcoin ATMs, payment gateways
(like BitPay), exchanges, anyone. Please note that the banks did not ask
for additional information about their clients. No communication, they
just delivered the contract cancellation notice. It is very suspicious
that several banks in unison started targetting all crypto businesses.

We may only speculate about the reasons, but a few of them probably
relate to the fact that *banks*, not police are supposed to find and
report any suspicious activity. Slovak Ministry of Interior issued a
statement in which they announced that cryptocurrencies are used for
financing terrorism and they should be considered suspicious. What would
bank do then? Close the accounts of these companies is by far the easiest
solution.

It would be no problem if banks decided to end bank accounts of
companies if having a bank account would not be a lawful requirement for
a business - in order to pay taxes. So it seems that the banks for whatever
reason can decide who can do business in the country and who can not.

It is very suspicious that among these companies are companies that pose
direct competitive threat to banks.

Who is responsible? There will be a lot of finger-pointing and the
result will be "no-one". Banks are responsible for identifying anything
suspicious. The government said that cryptocurrencies are suspicious. EU
says that anonymity and virtual currencies are a problem. So while
no-one directly banned crypto businesses, they cannot operate at least
in these countries.

Do you know of any other countries or banks that started behaving
similarly in the last month? Let us know. For what we can tell at least
in Slovakia and Czech Republic, this looks like a coordinated action.
While you might not care about small European countries, we believe that
this is a result of at least european regulatory framework and will
spread to other european countries.
