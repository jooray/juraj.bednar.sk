J. Hašto: Vzťahová väzba  
  
This is the book I am reading right now. I'm just starting, but it's getting pretty interesting. Currently, it is basically explaining roots and principles of [J. Bowlby][2]'s [attachement theory][3].  
  
I don't want to explain what is there. One thing I like is, that it is based on evolutionary biology.  
  
Anyways, it got me thinking once again about the formation of brain and the basic question: how much do we learn and how much do we get from our genetic inheritance?  
  
I am not aiming at answering this question here, it's quite deep (and I'm too uneducated in these manners). I personally think we have quite a good foundation genetically, it is (probably) very difficult to train such a large neural network as ours.   
  
I learned one example that confirms my belief (it's not even a theory, I am just learning), that babies know how to smile, even if they are blind. They have nowhere to learn it from... Yet, it is a complex operation and it's done by the brain itself. So it needs to somehow know it, without learning it from the environment.  
  
I also learned a lot about narcism and I am happy to see, that some of things I believe are still the current top theory by current psychiatry. Especially the importance of childhood for good mental health.  
  
It is important to know these things, because I someday want to be a good parent. Also, it is important to spot some problems early and be able to help others.  
  
This book is difficult for me to read, as I don't understand many psychiatric expressions.  
  
Interesting read anyways.
