Original description (not written by me, click on source to see original Flickr page of the author).  
  
_I got this _[idea from Daniel Drucker][2]_, who implemented it back when Flickr first started supporting geotagging._  
  
_ Th dots in the above illustration indicate the positions of about 1.2 million photos on Flickr tagged with the names of the lower 48 states: "Alabama", "Arizona", etc._  
  
_ It took about 15 hours for my computer to collect this information using the Flickr API, and then just a minute or two to plot the dots using a Perl script + ImageMagick. Fortunately, I had 15 hours to work on that script beforehand :)_  
  
_ Each dot is colored, not according to it's position, but according to its tag, which usually, (but not always!) corresponds to the state the photo was taken in. _  
  
_ So if a photo was tagged "New Jersey," it is colored reddish-pink, whether or not the dot actually appears within the boundaries of that state. Since __most__ of the photos tagged "New Jersey" were indeed taken in the Garden State, the state comes out looking reddish-pink -- and those smaller, densely populated states come out especially well in this system. _  
  
_ I also like the way the photos help bring out some of the major traffic arteries in less densely populated states, like Wyoming._  
  
_ As Daniel suggested, I used _[only 4 colors, according to this table][3]_, which insures that no two states of the same color touch. _
