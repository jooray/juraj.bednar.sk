We have finally arrived to Madrid, today we met another 3 Slovaks and 3 Austrians (2 from Metalab hackerspace). There was a bit panic on the Vienna airport - unattended luggage, a lot of security checking, maybe pyrotechnists, but fortunately no terrorists :)  
  
What is a really big fun - **that nobody of us knows what's going on EU Campus Party, what is our mission for another 4 days **:-)   
I guess this will be a big surprise from organizers!   
  
We came probably too late, because there was no food / no open restaurants here, we need to be patient with our hunger and wait for tomorrow :-)
