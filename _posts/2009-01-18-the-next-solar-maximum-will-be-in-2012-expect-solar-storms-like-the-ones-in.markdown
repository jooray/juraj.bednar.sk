The next solar maximum will be in 2012. Expect solar storms like the ones in 2001, which disrupted many electronical devices (including several hard disks of servers). It could produce much damage.   
  
The end of Mayan calendar? Could they predict the strength of a solar storm? I doubt so...  
  
But we will probably see a lot of Auroras. Should I plan a trip to northern pole? It's so cold there. And the radiation of solar storm is not so healthy.  
  
Watching Universe series is fun, esp. in HD.
