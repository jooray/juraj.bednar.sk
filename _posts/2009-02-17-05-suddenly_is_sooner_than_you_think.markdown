I carry it, your body from the freeway I cried as if my tears would bring you back to me the sirens followed close behind but they were too late deserved to drown the last words then you whispered suddenly is soon, sooner than you think suddenly is soon, sooner than you think suddenly is soon.. ..sooner than you think. outside under a road backwards into the ground miss you down, down miss you down, down suddenly is soon, sooner than you think suddenly is soon, sooner than you think
