"....security consultants Andrea Barisani and Daniele Bianco are preparing to unveil their methodology at the Black Hat USA conference for [stealing information typed on a computer keyboard using nothing more than the power outlet to which the computer is connected][1]. When you type on a standard computer keyboard, electrical signals run through the cable to the PC. Those cables aren't shielded, so the signal leaks via the ground wire in the cable and into the ground wire on the computer's power supply. The attacker [connects a probe to a nearby power socket, detects the ground leakage, and converts the signal back][2] into alphanumeric characters."
