I really don't like airports without free wireless access. They are usually already expensive enough, building a wifi infrastructure is not that huge investment (even if you buy it from Cisco). I understand why restaurants and cafes have paid wifi-they want you to eat your meal and drink whatever you have, pay and leave the seat free for next customer. At least some of them. And it's understandable. But at the airports, you are doomed for eternal waiting in lines, gates, etc. One nice example of an airport that has free wifi is Vienna. And when I'll get there, this message will get posted from my pocket.
