German [SSDeV][1] member [Ray][2] is known all around the world for his impressive collection of handcuffs and his fun ways of opening most of them. On top of that he gives great presentations and always manages to add a lot of humor into them!

At [HAR][5] he pulled another stunt: He used a [3D printer][6] to print handcuff keys. And not just any ordinary handcuff key … no, it’s the [official handcuff key][7] from the Dutch police! At first the police officers at HAR were a little reluctant to event try out the plastic key he printed. But he found another way to verify the key he printed was the correct one. I guess these officers [never thought about][8] wearing keys concealed, especially when [talking][9] with [Mr. Handcuff][10] himself. Given the megapixel camera’s on the market today it was not so difficult to verify the key he printed was the correct one.

At the end of the day he talked the officers into trying the key on their handcuffs and … [it did work!][13] At least the Dutch Police now knows there is a plastic key on the market that will open their handcuffs. A plastic key undetectable by metal detectors….

And Ray made it easy for you. For those of you wanting to print your own Dutch police handcuff key … the [STL][14] file is available online at <http://ke.y.nu/>

The New York Times just [came out with an article][15] on European lockpickers, quoting a Dutch Police officer who was not too negative about the lockpick scene. Lets hope they still feel this way after this post …

\*Warning\* Before you print out your keys please check your local law! Reading the [article][16] below ([pdf][17] mirror) should be a fair warning! In some places it is not quite healthy to run around wearing police handcuffs ….
