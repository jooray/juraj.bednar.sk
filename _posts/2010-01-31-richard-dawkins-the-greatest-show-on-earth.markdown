The latest book by Richard Dawkins: The Greatest Show on Earth is a huge surprise for me -- a positive one that is.   
  
His older books being sarcastic and even attacking religious belief (with arguments, not blindly, which I agree with), this one is utterly beautiful, describing the beauties of evolution, it's various manifestations and inner beauty.  
  
This book is peaceful, and a work of art as well as work of science. I highly recommend it.
