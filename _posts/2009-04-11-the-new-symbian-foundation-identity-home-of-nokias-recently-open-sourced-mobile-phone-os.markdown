The new [Symbian Foundation][2] identity, home of Nokia's recently open sourced mobile phone OS.  
It's intriguing how offbeat this is ([illustrations][3]), but is it trying too hard to come across as soft and cuddly? I'm a little skeptical that this identity will help attract developer goodwill, which I suppose is what they need right now to fight the notion they're becoming irrelevant compared to the iPhone and Android platforms. Also not at all a fan of their [font choice][4].
