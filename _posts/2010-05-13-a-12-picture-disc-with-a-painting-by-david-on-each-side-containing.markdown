A 12" picture disc, with a painting by David on each side, containing one 25-minute track on each side. Side I: ‘She is Naked Like the Water’; Side II: ‘The Sound of the Storm Was Spears’. The music is a Hallucinatory Meditation on the Themes of, and to, ‘Baalstorm, Sing Omega’ with Sidereal Vocals by David and contributions by Haunted C93.

The CD contains a different mix (which is also longer at 75 minutes, as opposed to the 50 minutes of the vinyl) of the music on the 12" picture disc.
