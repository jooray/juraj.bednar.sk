My colleague [xenol](http://blog.xenol.eu/) showed me a beautiful blogging engine called [Octopress](http://octopress.org/).
I decided to migrate to have more control over my blog, make use of static HTML blog and experiment with something new.
I wrote [a tool to do the migration](https://github.com/jooray/rss2octopress) which can be useful for others too.

I hope you will like this new blog. I am no web designer, so this is just a collection of my ramblings.

Janka said I need more pictures. So I am including one from 29c3 by andershh:

I also migrated [rss2kyberia](https://github.com/jooray/rss2kyberia) to Github. Code not changed, but it seems I will
be putting some more software to Github anyway. Fixed some bugs in imap-readlater, had a really interesting day, setup a new
Tor relay and a few other things. All is well.
