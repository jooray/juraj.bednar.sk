Richard Sulik, man behind Slovak great flat tax system is funding new political party. It's too soon to judge it now (and I'm not that interested in politics), but I believe the main aim of the party is to do another small revolution, this one of no equal kind anywhere in the world. It's called [Contribution Bonus][1] (the [same book in Slovak][2]) and I'm a huge fan of this idea. If you are at least marginally interested in politics and especially economy, it's an entertaining read (you don't have to be super-guru).  
  
I love how ellegant it is.  
  
Richard is a great economist, mind behind many great ideas that actually worked in practice....
