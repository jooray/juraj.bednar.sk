It's stable.  
  
 It does not have proper Bluetooth (can be used only for handsfree). For connecting to Internet from notebook, you need jailbreak and some application (I use _ssh -D_).  
  
 No cut &amp; paste.  
  
 Push e-mail, calendar and contacts work great.  
  
 It's not possible to use the phone while syncing.  
  
 No MMS  
  
No multitasking  
  
SSH client works (TouchTerm works even if you don't jailbreak)  
  
Great browser.  
  
Overall only after a few months of use. But it's retarded and the only reason I got it was, that maybe if it's retarded, the retarded parts will work well. Enough of crashing phones.  
  
What I'm really looking forward to is Android-based phones, when they mature.
