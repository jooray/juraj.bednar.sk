For paragliders training, NASA World Wind software could be a great software to start with.  
  
It could also replay your GPS logs live on earth, along with the view. That would be great thing to do. If anyone has plenty of time, implementing this should not be that difficult.  
  
You could replay your flights or do training with selected weather conditions. Or just play around. It's not as fun as motorized aircraft simulator, because it's slower, but could be fun anyways. Adding photos from the air (marked with GPS coordinates) to the view would be also possible and kind of nice as an additional layer.   
  
Anyone wanting to do it as a student project?
