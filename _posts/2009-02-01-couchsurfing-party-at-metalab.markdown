Yesterday was a great Couchsurfing party at Metalab. Just as a follow-up to spread the word for those that don't know Couchsurfing. If you are having a free bed or couch at home and are willing to host some traveller, you can join the community. They have a fairly good verification process and a reputation system, so you can quite confidently stay somewhere.   
  
The philosophy is not only about sleeping somewhere for free, it's about meeting people, talking to them and learning.  
  
Yesterday, I liked that I am in a place with people I did not know a month ago. Meeting new people is one of the wonders of being a human. You get to know the greatest people by accident or chance. And they become inevitable part of your life...  
  
Great project, just became a real member, so if you want to stay in Bratislava, you are welcome.
