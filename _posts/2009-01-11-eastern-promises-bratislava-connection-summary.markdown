[Our talk][1] at [MetaDay][2] went quite well, at least that's my impression. The afterparty was even better.  
  
For all those you, that were sick, did not know about it or were sick, the slides are on the metaday wiki or if you don't want to download ODP, [I put them on SlideShare][3].  
  
It has been a great day and I met lot of people, I hope I will visit other metadays. Metalab is kind of "hardware oriented", at least to my first opinion, with lots of Arduino stuff, blinking leds changing colors, etc. Me being a hardware-retard, I kind of liked it, mainly because I could not make such things. And they have a [RepRap][4] machine!
