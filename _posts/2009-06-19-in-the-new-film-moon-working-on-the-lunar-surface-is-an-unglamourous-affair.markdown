In the new film [_Moon_][2], working on the lunar surface is an unglamourous affair.

Sam Bell, played by Sam Rockwell, toils alone in a stark-white base, working as a glorified handyman for Lunar Industries, an ominously glossy corporation that extracts [helium-3][3] from the lunar surface to fuel fusion reactors back on Earth.

In this vision of the future, helium-3 supplies the majority of the world's energy needs, a scenario that is not entirely outlandish, as some suspect the moon contains a wealth of the material (see [_The mine on the moon_][4]). While the [cost][5] of retrieving the material may be prohibitive, in the world of _Moon_, Lunar Industries has found a way to make a profit, using mostly [autonomous][6], [regolith-munching][7] machines.
