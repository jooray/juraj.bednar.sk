I hope it is not too soon to claim, that today's EEA party was the best corporate party I've been to this year.  
  
Lots of great people, features like cigar tasting, really good tea ceremonies in one room (I know what I'm saying, they were performed by [Čajový dom][1]), mixed drinks, wine, great food, live jazz band and night outdoor activites. :)  
  
Had a lot of fun.
