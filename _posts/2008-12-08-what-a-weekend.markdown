I've done lots of tidying up.  
  
The flat, the computer. Uploading photos, tagging, uploading long forgotten videos. Some programming, lot of mail answering and writing. Lot of thinking.  
  
It reminds me, that I do most when I'm not at work, but alone at home.  
  
Ah, this weekend, I was (except for saturday lunch with Noele) mostly alone.  
  
Just ate cashew butter, cheese and a baguette. Want some sweets, set up alarm, go to sleep.
