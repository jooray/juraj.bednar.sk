I'm happy to announce that our Web Server product (about which I've been writing here for a few years now) is now open sourced and available as part of the [OpenSolaris Web Stack community][1]!

Well, technically it is not exactly the Web Server product, since the open sourced code does not include some of the value-add components such as the administration framework. But it is the real deal, the massively scalable web server core which is used in the JES Web Server 7.0 product is now all open source!
