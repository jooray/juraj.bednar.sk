Before seeing it, I had quite an entertaining experience and that scene from last episode of [Trailer park episode 7][1] instantly started playing in my head. That one, that said "You missed it" in the middle.  
  
After seeig [this movie][2], I have nothing more to say, there's just silence.  
  
I loved it.  
  
Recommend seeing it.
