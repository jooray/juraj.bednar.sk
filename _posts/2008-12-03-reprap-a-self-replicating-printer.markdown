RepRap is short for Replicating Rapid-prototyper. It is the practical self-copying 3D printer shown on the right - a self-replicating machine. This 3D printer builds the parts up in layers of plastic. This technology already exists, but the cheapest commercial machine would cost you about €30,000. And it isn't even designed so that it can make itself. So what the [RepRap][1] team are doing is to develop and **to give away** the designs for a much cheaper machine with the novel capability of being able to self-copy (material costs are about €500). That way it's accessible to small communities in the developing world as well as individuals in the developed world. Following the principles of the [Free Software Movement][2] we are distributing the [RepRap][3] machine at no cost to everyone under the [GNU General Public Licence][4]. So, if you have a [RepRap][5] machine, you can use it to make another and give that one to a friend...
