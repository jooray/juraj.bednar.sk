I hate some of them, such as LOL or ROFL. Especially these two and especially because they are used in real life, when someone is completely calm like Steven Segal and says "LOL", which should mean "Laughing Out Loud". It just irritates me.  
  
But today (maybe because I'm sick), I invented another one, it's a geeky one, but somehow I like it: LRTC (Lightly Retarded but [Turing Complete][1]).  
  
I shall go to hell for this.
