I got this book from Keso from Sun and it really made my day. I love reading stories like this, history of how it all began. Not just Java, every bright innovation. That's the reason why I recently got [Out of their minds][1].   
  
Anyways, it's an easy read and really an interesting one. I had no idea how it started, I just know the part with James Gossling doing it because he wanted to run it on all devices. But why? And why this kind of solution?  
  
I must admit, I like Java language a lot. It is really pleasant for me to write programs in it when I get the chance.
