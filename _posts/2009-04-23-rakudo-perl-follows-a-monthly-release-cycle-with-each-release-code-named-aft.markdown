"Rakudo Perl follows a monthly release cycle, with each release code named after a Perl Mongers group. This release is named "Bratislava", home to Jonathan Worthington and reportedly an excellent place to obtain beer (a key component of Jonathan's contributions to Perl). The Bratislava.pm group is quite active [2], with regular technical presentations and social gatherings."
