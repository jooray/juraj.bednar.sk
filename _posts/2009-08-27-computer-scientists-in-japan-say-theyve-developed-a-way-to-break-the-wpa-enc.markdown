"Computer scientists in Japan say they've developed a way to break the WPA encryption system used in wireless routers [in about one minute][1]. Last November, security researchers first showed how WPA could be broken, but the Japanese researchers have taken the attack to a new level. The [earlier attack][2] worked on a smaller range of WPA devices and took between 12 and 15 minutes to work. Both attacks work only on WPA systems that use the Temporal Key Integrity Protocol (TKIP) algorithm. They do not work on newer WPA 2 devices or on WPA systems that use the stronger Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm."
