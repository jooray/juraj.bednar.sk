I am attending Campus Party in Madrid, a conference organized by  
Spain's EU presidency. It contains section about computer security,  
so I believe it's a good idea to blog about Snake Oil security  
implemented here.  
  
Spain is a country with a quite high theft rate (including such  
advanced scam schemes as armed fake policemen stopping cars  
and stealing money). For this reason, I welcomed the fact, that  
there is a security measure against laptop theft at this conference.  
Sadly, I realized, it's a snake oil (security theatre) protection,  
because it does not work.  
  
Here's how it should work: You get a badge, that has your passport or  
ID number, you get a sticker on laptop, that has the same number. When  
you leave conference room, they check your bag, compare the numbers  
of laptop, if it's a match, you can go, otherwise, you are a burglar.  
  
The problem is this: They check the whole bag only if you say you  
have no laptop. If you have a laptop and show them, they check  
only the laptop and don't bother with checking the bag. That means,  
if you want to steal a laptop, you need to own another one (it does  
not have to work, it just needs to look as a laptop). When  
you are getting out, you just show the legitimate one and get out  
with a stolen one.  
  
Why this is bad? It actually makes the security situation worse --  
people think they are protected, so they are leaving laptops on  
the tables, because they think nothing bad can happen to it, they  
are checked!  
  
When applying any security measure, you need to make sure, that  
you understand what you are protecting against, develop a policy  
that works and make sure it's implemented correctly.   
  
This is, sadly, not the case with this conference. I am taking my  
laptop with me everywhere.
