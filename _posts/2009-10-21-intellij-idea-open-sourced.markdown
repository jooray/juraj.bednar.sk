I believe you’ll like this announcement — IntelliJ IDEA has just gone open-source! Check out the press release as well as the new [jetbrains.org][1] community site for the details. We all will soon get a lot of new friends and colleagues in our IntelliJ IDEA community!

Starting with the upcoming version 9.0, [IntelliJ IDEA][2] will be offered in two editions: Community Edition and Ultimate Edition. The Community Edition focuses on Java SE technologies, Groovy and Scala development. It’s free of charge and open-sourced under the Apache 2.0 license. The Ultimate edition with full Java EE technology stack remains our standard commercial offering. See the [feature comparison matrix][3] for the differences.

Briefly, in the free Community Edition you’ll get all the Java code support — various refactorings and code inspections, coding assistance; debugging, TestNG and JUnit testing; CVS, Subversion and Git support; Ant and Maven build integration; and Groovy and Scala support (through a separate plugin). To learn more and download the Public Preview of IntelliJ IDEA 9 Community Edition, please visit [the IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition site][4].

The IntelliJ platform, the common foundation for all our IDEs (IDEA, RubyMine, WebIDE or MPS), is being open-sourced under the APL 2.0, too.
