[JavaFX][1] is a new platform from Sun, that will hopefully get rid of Flash in many applications. I don't like Flash, it's too closed, not so portable, etc.   
  
JavaFX has 3d acceleration and it is able to play video (both natively using QuickTime and Windows Media Player and also using a portable codec, which is available everywhere).  
  
A little bit sad, that Linux and Solaris version is behind (i.e. not yet released).
